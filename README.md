----

Use MATLAB® in your web browser with the `matlab-proxy` Python® package.

Install the package to create an executable named `matlab-proxy-app`, which starts MATLAB and provides you a URL to access it. 
 
This package is under active development. To request technical support or to report issues, see [Feedback](#feedback).

## Requirements
* MATLAB® R2020b or later, installed and added to the system PATH.
  ```bash
  # Confirm MATLAB is on the PATH
  which matlab
  ```  
* The dependencies required to run MATLAB.
  For details, see the Dockerfiles in the [matlab-deps](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/container-images/tree/master/matlab-deps) repository for your desired version of MATLAB.

* Python versions: **3.8** | **3.9**  | **3.10** | **3.11**
* [Browser Requirements](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/browser-requirements.html)
* Supported Operating Systems:
    * Linux®
    * Windows® Operating System ( starting v0.4.0 of matlab-proxy )
    * MacOS (starting v0.5.0 of matlab-proxy )    

  For details, see [Platform Support](#platform-support). 

  
* X Virtual Frame Buffer (Xvfb) (for Linux® based systems):

  Installing Xvfb is optional (starting v0.11.0 of matlab-proxy) but highly recommended. Xvfb enables graphical abilities like plots and figures in the MATLAB desktop. 
  To install Xvfb on your Linux machine, use:

  ```bash
  # On a Debian/Ubuntu based system:
  $ sudo apt install xvfb
  ```
  ```bash
  # On a RHEL based system:
  $ yum search Xvfb
  xorg-x11-server-Xvfb.x86_64 : A X Windows System virtual framebuffer X server.

  $ sudo yum install xorg-x11-server-Xvfb
  ```
  

* Fluxbox Window Manager (only for Linux® based systems):

  Installing fluxbox is optional but required for using Simulink Online.

  Install fluxbox using:
  ```bash
  # On a Debian/Ubuntu based system:
  $ sudo apt install fluxbox 
  ```


## Installation

### PyPI
This repository can be installed directly from the Python Package Index.
```bash
python -m pip install matlab-proxy
```

### Building From Sources
Building from sources requires Node.js® version 18 or higher. [Click here to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathworks/matlab-proxy.git

cd matlab-proxy

python -m pip install .
```

Installing the package creates an executable called `matlab-proxy-app`, which is placed onto your system PATH by `pip`, usually in: `$HOME/.local/bin/`
```bash
# Confirm it is on the PATH
which matlab-proxy-app
```

## Usage

Once the `matlab-proxy` package is installed.

* Open a terminal and start `matlab-proxy-app`. On Linux, the command would be
  ```bash
  env MWI_BASE_URL="/matlab" matlab-proxy-app
  ```
  `MWI_BASE_URL` is an environment variable which controls the link on which MATLAB can be accessed.
  For a detailed listing of all environment variables. See [Advanced-Usage.md](./Advanced-Usage.md)

  Running the above command will print text out on your terminal, which will contain the URL to access MATLAB. For example:
  ```
  Access MATLAB at 
  http://localhost:44549/matlab/index.html
  ```

* Open the the link above in a web browser. If prompted to do so, enter credentials for a MathWorks account associated with a MATLAB license. If you are using a network license manager, then change to the _Network License Manager_ tab and enter the license server address instead. To determine the appropriate method for your license type, consult [MATLAB Licensing Info](./MATLAB-Licensing-Info.md).

</p>

* Wait for the MATLAB session to start. *This can take several minutes*.
<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="https://github.com/mathworks/matlab-proxy/raw/main/img/MATLAB_Desktop.png">
</p>

* To manage the MATLAB session, click the tools icon shown below.
<p align="center">
  <img width="100" src="https://github.com/mathworks/matlab-proxy/raw/main/img/tools_icon.png">
</p>

* Clicking the tools icon opens a status panel with buttons like the ones below:
<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="https://github.com/mathworks/matlab-proxy/raw/main/img/status_panel.png">
</p>

The following options are available in the status panel (some options are only available in a specific context):

| Option |  Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Start MATLAB | Start your MATLAB session. Available if MATLAB is stopped.|
| Restart MATLAB | Restart your MATLAB session. Available if MATLAB is running or starting.|
| Stop MATLAB | Stop your MATLAB session. Use this option if you want to free up RAM and CPU resources. Available if MATLAB is running or starting.|
| Sign Out | Sign out of MATLAB session. Use this to stop MATLAB and sign in with an alternative account. Available if using online licensing.|
| Unset License Server Address | Unset network license manager server address. Use this to stop MATLAB and enter new licensing information. Available if using network license manager.|
| Shut Down | Stop your MATLAB session and the `matlab-proxy` server.|
| Feedback | Provide feedback. Opens a new tab to create an issue on GitHub.|
| Help | Open a help pop-up for a detailed description of the options.|

## Examples
* For installing/usage in a Docker container, see this [Dockerfile](./examples/Dockerfile) and its [README](./examples/README.md).
* For upgrading **matlab-proxy** in an existing Docker image, see this [Dockerfile.upgrade.matlab-proxy](./examples/Dockerfile.upgrade.matlab-proxy) and its [README](./examples/README.md#upgrading-matlab-proxy-package-in-a-docker-image).
* For usage in a Jupyter environment, see [jupyter-matlab-proxy](https://github.com/mathworks/jupyter-matlab-proxy).

## Platform Support

### Linux
This package is fully supported for the Linux Operating System.

### Windows

Windows® Operating System support was introduced in package version `v0.4.0`.
Install the version >=0.4.0 to use the package on Windows.
```bash
# To upgrade an existing installation of matlab-proxy package:
$ pip install --upgrade matlab-proxy>=0.4.0
```

### MacOS

MacOS support was introduced in package version `v0.5.0`. 
It works best for MATLAB versions newer than R2022b.
Note: Figures *also* open in a separate windows on versions of MATLAB older than R2022b.

Install the version >=0.5.0 to use the package on MacOS.

```bash
# To upgrade an existing installation of matlab-proxy package:
$ pip install --upgrade matlab-proxy>=0.5.0
```

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2)

To install `matlab-proxy` in WSL 2, follow the steps mentioned in the [Installation Guide for WSL 2](./install_guides/wsl2/README.md).

## Using an already activated MATLAB with matlab-proxy
`matlab-proxy` version `v0.7.0` introduces support for using an existing MATLAB license. Use the Existing License option only if you have an activated MATLAB. This allows you to start MATLAB without authenticating every time.

## Limitations
This package supports the same set of MATLAB features and commands as MATLAB® Online. For the full list, see 
[Specifications and Limitations for MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online/limitations.html). 

Simulink Online is supported exclusively on Linux platforms starting from MATLAB R2024b.

## Security
We take your security concerns seriously, and will attempt to address all concerns.
`matlab-proxy` uses several other python packages, and depend on them to fix their own vulnerabilities.

All security patches will be released as a new version of the package.
Patches are never backported to older versions or releases of the package.
Using the latest version will provide the latest available security updates or patches.

## Feedback

We encourage you to try this repository with your environment and provide feedback.
